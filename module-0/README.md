# Overview
- Overview and quick understanding of what DevOps is as a philosophy
- Covers a quick overview of CI/CD, Monitoring, Security
- History of traditional development -> QA -> Security -> Operation code integration and deployment methology so that we understand what problems we are looking to solve with philosophy of DevOps

# Readings
- [What is devops](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/)
- [How did devops come to be](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/sre-vs-devops-competing-standards-or-close-friends)
- [Philosophy of devops](https://itrevolution.com/devops-culture-part-1/)

# Basics
- Operation System (Linux)
- unix file system
- Scripting (bash)
- Programming (ruby, python, java...etc, as long as you are okay one of the modern programming language)

# Get started
- Sign up for AWS
- Spin up a Ubuntu Server VM
- Learn about how Linux file system (/sys /usr /var)
- Learn about service management on Linux (systemd)
- Install a basic web service
- How it stands on TCP/IP module

## Steps
1. Head over to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and sign up a new account. This will include 12 months of free tier access. 
2. After you have signed up and logged in. You should be on the [AWS Management Console]() page. Look for *EC2* under *Compute* or just head over to [EC2](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#Home)
    - If you have time, here is a [AWS Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-technical-content/latest/aws-overview/aws-overview.pdf), Read page 1-8, 18-22, 22-25, 50-53. The topics you will be focusing on are Compute, Database, and Networking. This includes understanding terminology such as Virtual Machines, VPC, Elastic Load Balancer, RDS Database. 
<!-- 3. To Launch an EC2 (VM) instance, from the link of step 2, Click *Launch Instance*
    1. Select *Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type (64-bit x86)* 
    2. Select *General Purpose - t2 micro type*, then click *Next: Configure Instance Details* 
    3. Under Network and Subnet sections, Click *Create new VPC* and *Create new Subnet* 
        - If you want to read more about VPC and Subnet on AWS, head over to [AWS Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-technical-content/latest/aws-overview/aws-overview.pdf) and read page 50 for the overview or read up [What is Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html) 
    4. Once you have completed the steps above...  -->
3. Follow Step 1 and Step 2 from [AWS Quick Start Guide: Launch a Linux Virtual Machine](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/vmlaunch/welcome.html)
